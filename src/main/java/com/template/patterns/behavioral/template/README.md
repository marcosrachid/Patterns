# Template

If we take a look at the dictionary definition of a template we can see that a template is a preset format, used as a starting point for a particular application so that the format does not have to be recreated each time it is used.
On the same idea is the template method is based. A template method defines an algorithm in a base class using abstract operations that subclasses override to provide concrete behavior.
